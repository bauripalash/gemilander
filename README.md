> A Gemini protocol browser for android

### Introduction
This `gemilander` project is 'supposed' to be a gemini protocol browser for android.

### Status of the project
The gemtext parser is working.
Networking is not yet implemented, I'm currently focused to improve the gemtext parser, because networking is quite easy to implement.
